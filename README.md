How We Analyzed Commercial and Industrial Property Assessments in Chicago and Cook County

This code was used for the analysis in the story,["How the Cook County Assessor Failed Taxpayers."](https://features.propublica.org/the-tax-divide/cook-county-commercial-and-industrial-property-tax-assessments/)

To examine the fairness and accuracy of commercial and industrial property assessments under Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios, ProPublica Illinois and the Chicago Tribune conducted three separate analyses:

- An examination of unchanged assessor’s initial valuations over multiple reassessment periods

- A sales ratio study comparing the assessor’s valuations to actual sales prices

- A look at appeals of commercial and industrial assessments in Cook County

Methodology for this project can be found [here.](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/the-tax-divide-analysis) Each analysis has a methodology and results section in the full methodology.
